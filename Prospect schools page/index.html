<h1>School After C.O.C.C.</h1>
</div>  
<p>Students that attending community college have an important decision to make after they graduate from the two year institute. Where will they complete their undergrad studies and possibly even continue on to a graduate program?
    Here are my top picks for the next step in my journey to complete enlightenment.  </p>
    
    <p> <h1><a href="http://undergrad.osu.edu/majors-and-academics/majors/detail/39">The Ohio State University</a></h1>
        <p> <img src="https://fisher.osu.edu/blogs/gradlife/files/Fisher-Block.jpg" alt="Fisher School of Business"> </p>
        <h2 >The Ohio State university in Columbus Ohio has one of the top business programs in the U.S. and totes an impressive computer science department as well. 
            see the above link for a detailed look at the first year schedule and complete program details on the schools own website.  </h2>

    <p> The Universtiy of Ohio touts the infamous "The" infront of it's name due to the fact that in 1878 the board of trustees just did not beleive that "ohio argricultural and mechanical college"
        lived up to the schools reputation for greatness. I agree the later sounds terrible, however The Ohio State University has continued to live up that name by staying in the forefront of majors-and-academics 
        in all of it's majors. Most notably the school of medicine is the envy of all other school presidents. The Fisher school of business does not mess around either however, taking a hands on approach with their students
        many learn the ins and outs of running anything from a rural farm just minutes from the school to multinational firms that have no borders. This school is ready to create oportunity for anyone who is ready to grab life by the buckeye. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Computer Science Programs take place in math center at the school and focus heavily in the future of AI learning, graphics, networking, and systems engineering.

<h2>The University of Washington has a combination of exelent programs in both business finance and the computer sciences. Ranked among the top ten in both categories the school overlooks
    the sprawling city of Seattle, Washington and touts and impressive balance between exellence in education as well as a balanced life outside of school as well. 
</h2>
<br>
<p> UW offers the top programs in many schools of study, that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. This along with the work study and masters programs offered creates an alluring community 
    to be a part of. Take a look at the Hub a central hall that connects much of campus and offers a place to work on bicycles, eat, and also offers clubs that are focused on your core study
    requirments. This allows students to create and maintain relationships in their desired field of study. An exciting oportunity awaits any of those interested in becoming a Husky.
